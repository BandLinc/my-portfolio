         <div class="career">
             <p>I did Bsc. Computer Science. I have a work experience of 5 years.
             I decided to undertake a class of programming because I want to learn the new ways of code and tools that
             are in place. I also want to build a good foundation in programming and in the end come up with something
            great that will transform lives.</p>
            <p>Hobbies: Include Playing PIANO, Swimming and Bike Riding</p>
            <p>I am looking forward to an exciting experience at Moringa</p>
